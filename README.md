Vim Setup

This is my personal vim rc and .vim folders. They include all plugins and can be dropped in to have vim have settings exactly like mine


Plugins 
	NerdTree 
		Built in directory access
	Pathogen
		makes installing plugins easy
	DelimitMate
		Closes parenthesis, quotes, and others automatically
	autoclose
		HTML plugin that allow you to close html tags with the keyboard shortcut ctrl+_


	
I use different settings depending on the filetype using the built in filetype plugin.



Key Mappings
	F1 prev tab
	F2 next tab
	F3 NerdTree toggle
	F5 new tab
	F6 close tab


I deactivate caps lock on the computer I use, and I map it to ESC to make my life a little easier.
